# NSE Stock Analysis and closing price prediction using XGboost:
In this project i have worked on the NSE dataset of different industries and did complete EDA on those datasets along with creating required visualization to understand the features and problem statement which is to be solved.After complete analysis i nested two models for predicting the closing price and vloume shocks for each datasets using a regressor and a classifier from the XGBoost library.
## Environment Used:
- Google's colab(Free to use Jupyter Notebook)
## Dataset:
- NSE stock data(included in the repo.)
## Dependencies :
- Pandas,
- Numpy,
- Matplotlib,
- Altair,
- Scikit learn,
- XGBoost &
- Seaborn,etc.
## Observations and Results:
- worked data scraping from NSE,
- Preprocessed the datasets,
- visualized and observed the time series nature of the datasets,
- trained a Regressor and Classifier model,
- predicted the closing prices and the volume shocks for each stock and
- measures the M.A.E and the accuracy score of the predictions.
